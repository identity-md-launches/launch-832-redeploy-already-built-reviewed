# KING — King of the Hill on Uniswap v4

A fixed-supply ERC-20 (`KING`) paired with native ETH in a Uniswap v4 pool whose hook runs a
"King of the Hill" throne game funded by an ETH trading fee. The static wallet-connected frontend lives in `web/`.

This is the fee-policy redeployment of launch 814, pinned in `SOURCE.json`. The only production
contract change is `KingHook.beforeInitialize` accepting the factory LP fee **12500 (1.25%)**.
See [redeployment status and responsibilities](docs/REDEPLOYMENT.md) and [web build/release](web/README.md).
No Robinhood deployment or public website is claimed by this source deliverable.

## Chain

The target is **Robinhood Chain mainnet (4663)**. The hook uses `block.timestamp`, takes the
factory's PoolManager as an argument, and requires Cancun transient storage. Network details
were checked against [Robinhood documentation](https://docs.robinhood.com/chain/connecting/)
and the public RPC returned `0x1237` on 2026-10-06. No Robinhood PoolManager address or deployment
receipt was supplied. The original Base fork tests are retained as regression rehearsals only;
they are not evidence of a Robinhood deployment. The factory supplies `$poolManager`.

## The token

`KingToken` is OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` with a constructor that mints exactly `10^27` minor units
(1,000,000,000 KING, 18 decimals) to `msg.sender`. No owner, no mint, no burn, no pause, no
blocklist, no transfer fee, no proxy. The brief asked nothing of the token beyond this; every
rule of the game, including the trading fee, lives in the hook.

## The pool

* `currency0` = native ETH (`address(0)`), `currency1` = KING, LP fee 12500 (1.25%), tick spacing 60.
* Initial price: 1e8 KING per ETH, so 1e9 KING is a **10 ETH market cap**.
  `sqrtPriceX96 = sqrt(1e8) · 2^96 = 792281625142643375935439503360000` (tick 184216).
* Launch liquidity: 90% of supply (900,000,000 KING) single-sided, 0% to the requester. A KING-only
  position must sit entirely below the current tick, e.g. `[-887220, 184200]`; the tests and the
  fork rehearsal seed exactly that range. The factory owns the position and its LP fees.
* The hook accepts exactly one pool: ETH/KING at an LP fee of 12500 (1.25%). Anything else,
  including the dynamic-fee flag, is refused in `beforeInitialize`, and a second initialization is
  refused too. The factory deploys the token, then the hook, then initializes the pool in one
  transaction, so nobody can open the pool before the hook has code.

## The fee

Every swap pays a fee **in ETH**, on the settled ETH side of the trade:

| Swap | Specified amount | Where the fee is taken | Formula |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buy, exact input | ETH in | `beforeSwap`, as a hook delta on the specified ETH: the pool swaps `in − fee` | `fee = in · r` |
| Buy, exact output | KING out | `afterSwap`, as a hook delta on the unspecified ETH: the buyer pays `poolEth + fee` | `fee = poolEth · r / (1 − r)` |
| Sell, exact input | KING in | `afterSwap`, as a hook delta on the unspecified ETH: the seller receives `out − fee` | `fee = out · r` |
| Sell, exact output | ETH out | `beforeSwap`, as a hook delta on the specified ETH: the pool pays `out + fee` | `fee = out · r / (1 − r)` |

In every case the fee is `r` of the **gross** ETH that changes hands (what the buyer pays in
total, or what the pool pays out in total). `r` starts at **25%** when the pool is initialized and
falls linearly to **2.5%** over **30 minutes**, then stays there forever.

Split: **92%** to the throne pool, **8%** credited to the team wallet
`0x39E3414e7a43DE41675e9bEC52F7C9F6ae489CB6`, which pulls it with `claim()` like any king.
Nothing else can move money out of the throne pool.

### How the fee is held

The hook never asks the PoolManager to transfer ETH during a swap. It mints itself an ERC-6909
claim for the fee (`poolManager.mint(hook, 0, fee)`) inside `afterSwap`; the claim is backed by the
swapper's own settlement, so the first buy on a fresh PoolManager with a token-only pool works
(tested in `test_firstBuyOnManagerHoldingNoEthSucceeds` and on the Base fork). Payouts burn claims
and `take` ETH inside a PoolManager unlock the hook itself opens. Consequences:

* The PoolManager's ETH balance always covers the hook's claims (invariant-tested).
* A recipient that cannot receive ETH (a contract without `receive`) only breaks **its own**
  `claim()`; it cannot halt anybody else's swap or claim. This holds for the team wallet too.
  A wallet using `buyExactOut` must also accept native ETH refunds from the PoolManager; otherwise
  a surplus refund reverts its entire buy. `buyExactIn` needs no refund receiver. Sells likewise
  require the selling wallet to accept their native ETH output.

### Partial fills

For the two cases charged in `beforeSwap` the fee is computed on the specified amount. If the pool
could not fill that amount (price limit reached) the hook reverts with `PartialFill` rather than
overcharge. With the launch liquidity reaching the minimum tick, an exact-input buy never partially
fills; an exact-output sell larger than the pool's ETH reverts (tested).
An exact-input KING sell can partially fill when the curve runs out of ETH. The router refunds
`requested KING - actual KING consumed` to that seller and reports actual consumption in `Swapped`.
Exact-output sells likewise refund only their own unused `maxKingIn`; they cannot sweep earlier
balances or use them to exceed the caller's budget. Do not send tokens directly to the router:
unsolicited deposits have no recovery function.

## The throne

* **Opens** when the anti-snipe period ends (`gameStart = launchTime + 30 min`). Before that the
  throne is empty, fees only fill the pool, and a must-take buy reverts.
* **Takeover**: one buy through `KingRouter` whose ETH amount, fee included, is at least
  `currentThronePrice()` makes the buyer king immediately. Several small buys never add up. Exact
  input and exact output both count (`paid = poolEth + fee` for exact output).
* **Price**: `max(0.01 ETH, 1.2 · paid · 2^(−hoursSinceTakeover))`. Exactly half at each full hour
  (`Halving` applies whole halvings as shifts). Empty throne: 0.01 ETH. `nextHalvingTime()` tells
  when it next halves, 0 at the floor.
* **Income**: while there is a king the pool pays `2%` of itself per hour, compounded per second:
  `pool(t) = pool(t0) · 0.98^((t − t0)/3600)`, the difference credited to the king. It is
  path-independent up to fixed-point rounding. `incomePerHour()` is 2% of the current pool.
  Vested income is claimable during and after a reign.
* **Holding rule**: the king must keep at least the KING his takeover delivered
  (`requiredBalance`). Any sell by the king through `KingRouter` empties the throne at once,
  whatever the amount. Every swap also checks `balanceOf(king) >= requiredBalance` in `beforeSwap`,
  `claim()` and permissionless `dethrone()` also check it **before** accrual or vesting. On a short
  balance, provisional income and income since `lastAccrual` stay in the pool; already vested
  credits remain claimable. Sells by anyone else never end a valid king's reign.
  The router calls authenticated `prepareSell(msg.sender)` before pulling KING, so a valid king's
  sell is recorded as `Sold`, including exact-output sells with temporary maximum-input escrow.
* **Same king again**: a buy by the sitting king that meets the price is a new reign (new price
  base and history entry). Its holding requirement is `max(previous requirement, new buy's KING)`;
  a self-retake cannot reduce it. The new reign starts a fresh five-minute vesting period.
* **Must-take flag**: `KingRouter.buyExactIn/buyExactOut(..., mustTake = true, ...)` reverts the
  whole swap (no fee, no tokens, nothing) if the buy would not take the throne.

### Income vesting: the defence against throne farming

See the analysis below. The income earned in the first **5 minutes** of a reign vests only when
the reign is 5 minutes old and the holding check succeeds. **Every** earlier end forfeits the
income, including self-retakes and rival takeovers; cooperating wallets cannot accelerate vesting.
An honest king outbid before five minutes also forfeits it (less than about 0.169% of the starting
pool without intervening fees). Balance failures forfeit all provisional income plus the unverified
interval since `lastAccrual`, regardless of how long the reign lasted (`Reign.forfeited`, event
`IncomeForfeited`). That interval is retained in the pool without first crediting it to the king. `unclaimedIncome(king)` shows what
is claimable now; `kingVestingIncome()` shows what is earned but not yet claimable; `throne()`
carries both and `vestsAt`.

## Identifying the real buyer

Inside a hook `msg.sender` is the PoolManager and the `sender` argument is the router, never the
user. The options and their trade-offs:

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| `sender` (the router) | A shared router (Universal Router) would be "the buyer" for everyone. |
| `tx.origin` | Forbidden by the security reference: a phishing vector, and wrong for smart wallets, 4337 bundlers and Safes, where `tx.origin` is a relayer. |
| hookData from any router | Any contract can name any address. Harmless to the pool but lets a griefer crown a stranger, and the hook cannot know whether that address received the tokens. |
| **hookData from a router the hook owns** (chosen) | The hook deploys `KingRouter` in its constructor and trusts hookData only when `sender == router`. The router writes `msg.sender` into hookData and always delivers the output to `msg.sender`, so the buyer named is the wallet that holds the tokens, which the holding rule needs. |

Swaps through any other router (Uniswap app, aggregators) pay the fee like everyone else but
cannot take the throne. Canonical 64-byte `abi.encode(buyer, true)` hookData from such a router
reverts with `ThroneNotTaken`, even above the price: the flag never silently charges a fee for a
throne the router cannot take. Foreign buyer identity and unrelated metadata are ignored.
The website should route through `hook.router()`.

A sell by the king through a third-party router cannot be attributed during that swap, because such
routers pull the tokens **after** the hook ran. The balance check catches it at the next swap by
anyone, `claim()`, or `dethrone()`. The throne price is recomputed after that dethrone inside
the same swap, so the next buyer takes an empty throne at the floor. Through `KingRouter` the
dethrone is immediate. Detection forfeits the unverified interval, rather than paying a non-holder
through the quiet period. A claim that detects a short balance succeeds with zero payout if it
has nothing else to pay, so the dethrone persists; an ordinary empty claim still reverts.

A plain ERC-20 exposes no historical balance at the time tokens left. An honest holder should
claim vested income before transferring below the requirement; otherwise income since the last
successful checkpoint is lost. Exits followed by restoring the balance between observations
cannot be detected, and foreign-router sells of surplus cannot be attributed. Enforcing every
sell through arbitrary routers immediately would require restricting routers or changing the
plain-token design. These limits remain explicit; `dethrone()` and monitoring provide observation,
not proof of continuous historical holding.

## Bot farming: what we saw and what defends against it

* **Take-and-dump skimming.** Take the throne at the floor, hold one block, sell, repeat. The
  income of one 2-second Base block is `pool · 2% · 2 / 3600`; the round trip costs two fees (about
  5% of 0.01 ETH). It is profitable only for a pool above ~45 ETH on Base (~7.5 ETH on a 12-second
  chain) and would keep the throne permanently occupied by a bot at the floor. **Defence**: the
  5-minute income vesting above. No reign ending inside five minutes earns income, including
  self-retakes and two-wallet relays. This imposes a minimum exposure period, not a guarantee
  against profitable farming: five uncontested minutes earn about 0.1682% of the pool, while a
  0.01 ETH round trip costs roughly 0.00055 ETH in hook/LP fees before gas and price impact.
  A pool of roughly 0.33 ETH can already make that strategy profitable.
* **Sandwiching / front-running a takeover.** On a public mempool a bot can front-run a takeover
  with a slightly larger buy. The victim then either buys tokens without the throne or, with the
  **must-take flag**, reverts and pays no fee. The front-runner now holds the throne at 1.2× what it
  paid. Sequencer ordering, private order flow and latency advantages remain risks on Base;
  the hook makes no fairness guarantee about transaction inclusion or ordering.
* **Sequencer ordering / latency races.** After a vacancy the price is the floor by specification,
  so the first buy to reach the sequencer wins it; a latency bot will usually win that race. The
  next player can take it for 1.2 × 0.01 ETH and income from a few seconds is forfeited. A bot
  that remains uncontested for five minutes can still profit; latency and capital both matter.
* **Block stuffing / censorship.** Price and income use `block.timestamp`, avoiding per-block
  rewards, but suppressing rival transactions for five minutes can still protect a profitable
  reign. Timestamp changes also affect vesting. The hook cannot prevent sequencer censorship.
* **Flash loans.** A new reign earns no income within its creation transaction. An existing
  reign's holdings are checked only at observations; temporary balance restoration remains a
  limitation of using a plain ERC-20.
* **Self-dethrone to reset the price.** Only hurts the king who does it: the throne empties and
  anyone may take it at the floor.

## Views for the website

All on `KingHook` (see `IKingHook`):
`king()`, `reignStart()`, `requiredBalance()`, `takeoverPaid()`, `currentThronePrice()`,
`nextHalvingTime()`, `poolSize()`, `incomePerHour()`, `unclaimedIncome(wallet)`,
`kingReignEarnings()`, `kingVestingIncome()`, `pendingIncome(wallet)`, `feeRate()`,
`gameOpen()`, `gameStart()`, `launchTime()`, `reignCount()`, `getReign(i)`,
`getReigns(offset, limit)` (past kings with start, end, paid, required, earned, forfeited,
reason) and `throne()` which packs the live state into one struct. `router()` returns the
official router; `poolKey()` the pool.

## Hook configuration (Wizard record)

```json
{
  "hook": "BaseHook",
  "name": "KingHook",
  "pausable": false,
  "currencySettler": false,
  "safeCast": true,
  "transientStorage": true,
  "shares": { "options": false },
  "permissions": {
    "beforeInitialize": true, "afterInitialize": false,
    "beforeAddLiquidity": false, "afterAddLiquidity": false,
    "beforeRemoveLiquidity": false, "afterRemoveLiquidity": false,
    "beforeSwap": true, "afterSwap": true,
    "beforeDonate": false, "afterDonate": false,
    "beforeSwapReturnDelta": true, "afterSwapReturnDelta": true,
    "afterAddLiquidityReturnDelta": false, "afterRemoveLiquidityReturnDelta": false
  },
  "inputs": {},
  "access": "none",
  "info": { "license": "MIT" }
}
```

The hook implements `IHooks` directly on v4-core (no v4-periphery dependency) with an
`onlyPoolManager` modifier on every enabled callback; unused callbacks revert
`HookNotImplemented`. `beforeSwapReturnDelta` is used only to take the ETH fee from a specified
ETH amount (never to no-op a swap); `afterSwapReturnDelta` only to take the ETH fee from an
unspecified ETH amount. Transient storage is OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuardTransient`
(Cancun). Address flags: `0x20CC` (`HookFlags.KING_HOOK_FLAGS`). Access control: none, by design.

## Deployment parameters

* Compiler `solc 0.8.26`, `evm_version = cancun`, optimizer 200 runs, `via_ir = false`,
  `bytecode_hash = "none"`, `cbor_metadata = false`, no `ffi`, no fs permissions.
* Hook constructor: `(IPoolManager poolManager, address token)`, written `["$poolManager", "$token"]`
  in `launch.json`. The constructor requires both addresses to have code and deploys `KingRouter`.
* The hook address must carry flags `0x20CC`; `HookFlags.mine(deployer, flags, creationCode, n)`
  finds a CREATE2 salt (the deployer is whoever executes CREATE2).
* Pool: ETH/KING, fee 12500, tick spacing 60, `sqrtPriceX96 = 792281625142643375935439503360000`.
* Liquidity: 900,000,000 KING in a range whose upper tick is at most the initial tick (184216),
  e.g. `[-887220, 184200]`.
* `script/Deploy.s.sol`: `run()` reads `POOL_MANAGER` from the environment and calls
  `deploy(poolManager, create2Deployer)`, which the tests call directly. It is a rehearsal aid;
  the factory performs the launch.

## Operational responsibilities

* **Nobody can pause, upgrade, or change a parameter.** There is no owner. Deploy only after an
  independent adversarial review (see `docs/REVIEW.md` for the first pass and its open items).
* **Team wallet** must call `claim()` on the hook to receive its 8%. If that wallet is a contract
  it must accept plain ETH transfers.
* **Website** should use `hook.router()` for buys and sells (`buyExactIn`, `buyExactOut`,
  `sellExactIn`, `sellExactOut`, all with slippage and deadline parameters) so that takeovers and
  the must-take flag work, and should warn that a sell through another venue which leaves the king
  below the requirement drops the throne at the next observation, forfeiting unverified income.
  Foreign-router surplus sells cannot be identified.
* **Monitoring**: `ThroneTaken`, `ThroneVacated`, `IncomeVested`, `IncomeForfeited`, `Claimed`,
  `FeeCollected`. Anyone may call `dethrone()` when the king's balance falls short; a keeper is
  optional because every swap and claim does the same check.
* **Explorer verification** (`forge verify-contract`) is the deployer's step; verify the token, the
  hook and `hook.router()`.

## Tests

```
forge build
forge test
forge fmt --check
```

* `test/KingToken.t.sol` — supply, transfer, no admin surface, opcode scan.
* `test/Halving.t.sol` — exactness at half-lives, 2^(−½), the 0.98-per-hour constant, fuzzing.
* `test/KingHook.Fee.t.sol` — anti-snipe decay, ETH fee on all four paths, settled-delta
  computation, 92/8 split (fuzzed), fresh-manager buy, rejecting recipients.
* `test/KingHook.Throne.t.sol` — opening, takeover at/below price, 1.2×, hourly halving to the
  floor, per-second 2%/h income, path independence, claims during and after a reign, holding rule
  through both routers, `dethrone()` success and refusals, must-take, vesting, history, views.
* `test/KingHook.Security.t.sol` — flags, opcode scan, caller checks, initialization rules,
  reentrancy (claim, swap and dethrone during a payout), foreign hookData, no admin surface,
  partial fill, lifecycle solvency.
* `test/KingHook.Invariant.t.sol` — random play: claims back the pool and every credit, the
  manager holds the ETH, the hook and router hold nothing, throne state consistent.
* `test/KingHook.Revision.t.sol` — partial-fill refunds and sweep prevention, sell-budget isolation,
  self-retake and relay vesting, all balance-failure observation paths, preserved vested claims,
  authenticated sell checkpoints and rollback, foreign must-take, refund rejection and rounding.
* `test/Deploy.t.sol` — the script's `deploy()` on a fresh PoolManager.
* `test/fork/KingHookFork.t.sol` — launch rehearsal on a **Base mainnet fork** against the live
  PoolManager. It skips (never passes silently) when no RPC is reachable, so the offline verifier
  reports it as skipped; with network access it runs and passed on 2026-10-06.

The original submission recorded the protected floor suite and Slither results. For this revision,
see `docs/REVISION.md` for reproduced proofs, regression results and independent agent review.
Slither is unavailable in this workspace; no fresh Slither result is claimed. The rejected
callback `transferFrom(user, ...)` pattern was not reintroduced: both pulls still use `msg.sender`
in the public sell entry points. Fuzz runs: 256; invariant runs 24 × depth 48.

## Assumptions and limitations

* The launch chain is Robinhood Chain (4663); the legacy Base fork tests are historical regressions.
* The LP fee is exactly 12500 (1.25%), additional to the hook fee; zero, dynamic, and legacy tiers are rejected.
* Timestamps come from the sequencer; drift of seconds changes income by parts per million.
* The income formula is "2% of the pool per hour, compounded per second" (`0.98^(hours)`), the
  path-independent reading of "credited every second".
* "A single buy" is one swap; the brief's amount is the fee-inclusive ETH the buyer pays.
* The five-minute vesting rule and router observation limits are preserved from reviewed launch 814. They differ from the simplified brief's immediate claimability and universal sell attribution; this fee-only redeployment does not redesign them.
* Takeovers are only possible through `KingRouter`; third-party routers pay the fee only.
* The `Halving` library needs `value < 2^192`; ETH amounts are far below that.
